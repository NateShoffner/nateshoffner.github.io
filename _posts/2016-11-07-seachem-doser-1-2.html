<p>Seachem Doser 1.2 is now available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nateshoffner.seachemdoser">Play Store</a>.</p>

<p>Major changes include metric support, new products (see below), and an interface redesign with improved material design.</p>

<p>Previously, I was having to resort to reverse-engineering Seachem's Flash-based dosage calculators in order to obtain dosage calculations. Thankfully, they finally added web-based <a href="http://seachem.com/calculators.php">dose calculators</a>, albeit with some errors/miscalculations on their end at the time of writing this.
</p>

<p>Additionally, support for Honeycomb and below has been dropped due to insignificant user distribution and the effort required to provide backwards compatibility. Sorry for the few of you that this may affect.</p>
