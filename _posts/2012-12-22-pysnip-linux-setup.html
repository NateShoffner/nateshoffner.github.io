<p>This is just a small guide on how to setup PySnip on Linux. If you want to set it up on Windows, there is already a featured server <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pysnip/downloads/list" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>This guide assumes basic experience with a terminal and your distro's package manager.</p>

<p>Since Ubuntu seems to be the most common distro, I'll provide instructions that use apt-get. If you use a different distro/manager, please refer to your package-manager documentation for the appropriate commands.</p>

<p>First, install the dependencies:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev python-setuptools python-twisted mercurial gcc g++ zope.interface
sudo python -m easy_install cython
sudo python -m easy_install pil
sudo python -m easy_install jinja2</pre>

<p>Next, you can install screen if you'd like:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install screen</pre>

<p>Another optional feature is pygeoip, which will allow you to use the /from command, showing you where individual players are located geographically.</p>

<p>Next you need to either clone the repository using Mercurial.</p>

<pre>hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pysnip/
cd pysnip
sh build.sh</pre>

<p>If you don't want to clone the repo, you can download an up-to-date zipped archive of the sourceÂ <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pysnip/source/browse/" target="_blank">here</a>. Just download and extract as normal.</p>

<p>Next you need to edit the configuration:</p>

<pre>cd feature_server
nano config.txt</pre>

<p><strong>Make sure you change your admin password from the default one.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, run the server:</p>

<pre>sh run_server.sh</pre>

<p>Or if you are using screen:</p>

<pre>screen sh run_server.sh</pre>
