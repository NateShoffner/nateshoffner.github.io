<p>It hasn't been long since the last update, but since than Ace of Spades 0.60 Beta has been released with some new file formats and a bunch of cool new features.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>I was hoping to add more stuff in this release, but kind of had to push it out due to the amount of messages I've received about bugs with 1.4.8 because of new INI formats and lack of support for new 0.60 features such as windowed mode and mouse sensitivity.</p>
