<p>So I'm about 8 months late to posting this. Granted, I'm quite behind on posting a lot of developments (sleep deprivation puns). Anyway, Seachem Doser is an Android app that I developed a while ago that serves as a "dosage/quantity calculator" for various products Seachem offers.</p>

<p>Seachem, for those who don't know/have lives, is a company that offers various products geared towards maintaining freshwater and marine aquariums. Personally, I use a lot of their products for my high-tech planted aquariums.</p>

<p>They offer calculators on their site that allow you to calculate how much you should dose specific fertilizers, buffers, conditioners, the amount of gravel needed per a specific volume, etc. Sadly, these calculators are all Flash-based. So I decided to make one that's a bit more flexible. I should note that all of the values for these calculations were pulled from their official calculators, after a bit of reverse-engineering. At first I just made a Windows-based calculator/library that you can find on <a href="https://github.com/NateShoffner/Seachem.NET" target="_blank">Github</a>. Eventually the issue of convenience took hold and I decided to make it mobile.</p>

<p>As of today, I just updated it to work on tablets and polished things up a bit since I had some free time.</p>

<p>As with the Windows version, the Android version is also open source on <a href="https://github.com/NateShoffner/Seachem-Doser" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

<p>If you happen to be somebody who will find it useful, feel free to download it through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nateshoffner.seachemdoser" target="_blank">Play Store</a>.</p>
