<p>Since I keep getting messages from every direction about this, I figured I'd make a post.</p>

<p>Jagex has bought Ace of Spades and has shut down their master server. Spadille 1.5.1 (latest public release) used their master server and is therefor broken.</p>

<p><strong>I will be updating this when I get the chance.</strong></p>

<p>I will also likely be making a post regarding Ace of Spades 1.0, Jagex, and all that jazz.</p>

<p>For the time being, please visit our alternative community <a href="http://www.buildandshoot.com/" target="_blank">Build and Shoot</a>. I have reverse-engineered the master server protocol and created a new one, along with creating a new, open-source game server called <a href="http://www.buildandshoot.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;p=3293" target="_blank">PySnip</a> (hosted on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pysnip/" target="_blank">Google Code</a>). We have a serverlist set up <a href="http://www.buildandshoot.com/serverlist" target="_blank">here</a>, where you can join servers just as you always have.</p>
