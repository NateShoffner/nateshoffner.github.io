<p>Well, over a year and a half later, I suppose I should release Spadille 1.6 eh?</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>Spadille dropped off the grid a bit after being put on the back burner a while ago. I stopped working on it during the middle of refactoring...which is a bad idea. It's been ready for release for a long time now, but I just never released it. Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow? This version does not support <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/yvt.jp/openspades/" target="_blank">OpenSpades</a> yet, but I will release a quick patch shortly for it.</p>

<p>You can download Spadille 1.6 <a href="/projects/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>

<p>- Countless minor UI changes<br />
- Fixed a bunch of minor bugs<br />
- Improved memory usage<br />
- Improved threading<br />
- Rewrote screenshot hooking, caching and manager<br />
- Added dynamically populated server filters<br />
- Added share link<br />
- Added autocomplete to server browser<br />
- Added mumble link<br />
- Removed deprecated dependencies<br />
- Fixed support for Build and Shoot<br />
- Abstracted Spadille client and SpadilleDotNet library<br />
- Added "Last Played" column<br />
- Added intermediate dialog when joining server</p>

<h3>Related Notes:</h3>
<p>I'll likely be releasing my library that Spadille is based on (along with a few other projects), SpadilleDotNet. It's a C#/.NET (2.0 compliant) library that provides a lot of functionality for working with Ace of Spades Classic (Voxlap/OpenSpades), Build and Shoot, Ace of Spades 1.0, and more.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have a few more tools that I'll be releasing here soon as well, as I start to dig through old projects that I've not released, so keep an eye out.</p>
