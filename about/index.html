title: About Me
---

<p>I am a 26 year old software and web developer currently living in the United States. I am an avid computer enthusiast and enjoy developing software and web applications as well as working with hardware. In my free time I like to play guitar, work with circuitry, and play <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/syntack" target="_blank">video games</a>.</p>

<p>I have been programming for about 10 years now, working with a variety of languages and frameworks. I will fully admit to being a bit of a C# fanatic and if you find that to be absurd, you have either never used C#, are a bad person, and/or have not yet read Jon Skeet’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Depth-Second-Edition-Jon-Skeet/dp/1935182471" target="_blank">C# in Depth</a>.</p>

<p>A few of my personal projects can be found <a href="/projects/">here</a>, but I can’t promise they’ll be updated, as I am often busy and love to procrastinate.</p>

<p>I often perform freelance/contract work, if you are interested and/or want to see my portfolio and resume for professional work, feel free to <a href="/contact/">message me</a>.</p>

<h4 class="headline">Pirate Party</h4>
<p>I am a firm supporter of the <a href="http://pirate-party.us/" target="_blank">United States Pirate Party</a>, a political party that pushes intellectually property reform, government transparency, privacy protection, free culture, egalitarianism, and more. Currently, the Pirate Party is not [yet] recognized as an legitimate political party in my home state of Pennsylvania, but we are working to change that.</p>

<h4 class="headline">Build and Shoot</h4>
<p><a href="http://buildandshoot.com" target="_blank">Build and Shoot</a> is a community operated by <a href="http://buldthensnip.com" target="_blank">Buld Then Snip, LLC</a>, a company founded and operated by myself and another individual that focuses on supporting the classic version of the game “Ace of Spades”. After being bought out by another studio and moving to a pay-to-play release, we decided to branch off and continue support for the free-to-play version. By leveraging open-source software such as <a href="https://github.com/NateShoffner/PySnip" target="_blank">PySnip,</a> <a href="https://github.com/yvt/OpenSpades" target="_blank">OpenSpades</a>, community-driven development, and our own proprietary software, we have been able to do just that. Feel free to try it yourself, it’s completely free to play.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at nate.shoffner(at)gmail.com.</p>
